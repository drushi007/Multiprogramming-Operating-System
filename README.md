# Multiprogramming-Operating-System

This project is the simulation of Muliprogramming Operating System. Some concepts of operating system like Interrupt handling, Process synchronization, scheduling, Paging, Process and Resource data structures etc. are implemented and simulated.
The primary purpose of the MOS is to process a batched stream of user jobs efficiently. This
is accomplished by multiprogramming systems and user processes.
